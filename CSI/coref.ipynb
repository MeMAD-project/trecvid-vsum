       "'Synopsis A grisly collision between a car and an eighteen-wheeler leads to a murder investigation at a furry convention. Meanwhile, a man is found dead in a freezer in an apparent robbery-homicide.  Plot Victims: Linda Jones (deceased), Robert Pitt (deceased)  On the case: Catherine Willows, Gil Grissom, Warrick Brown, Jim Brass  On a dimly lit stretch of road, Linda Jones is driving and looking for something. She suddenly collides with something, causing a loud thud. As she looks back to see what she hit, she swerves into oncoming traffic, and collides with an 18-wheeler truck. Later that night, while officers investigate the truck driver, Grissom and Catherine follow Linda\\'s tire tracks and see that she was braking for quite a while. They see a set of extremely large animal paw prints leading off the road, and find another victim: a man in a raccoon fursuit.  The next day, Grissom and Willows further investigate the \"raccoon\". Willows reveals that she once dated a Detroit Lions mascot, while David Phillips is reminded of a children\\'s show he once loved that starred a raccoon character. Grissom determines that the raccoon\\'s cause of death was blunt force trauma by motor vehicle, implying that he was the \"thud\" that Linda Jones hit before her death. They also find a piece of blue fur in the raccoon\\'s mouth.  The man in the raccoon suit revealed to be an Alcoholics Anonymous participant. While cutting the man out of his costume, a great deal of blood spills out, as it had nowhere else to escape; the forensics team finds a high-velocity bullet wound, thus adding to the man\\'s injuries.  In the lab, the blue fur found in the mouth is confirmed synthetic, and the raccoon is identified as Robert Pitt, who was court-ordered to join AA after being arrested for driving under the influence. A sample of Pitt\\'s digestive system reveals he had no alcohol in him, but rather ipecac (an emetic) and civet oil (an aphrodisiac).  Catherine and Brass search Robert\\'s residence, where they find a bedroom full of raccoon stuffed animals, as well as a calendar with October 29-November 1, 2003, marked as a \"PAF-Con\" meeting at the Kings River Hotel. She and Grissom go to this PAF-Con - the Plushies and Furries Convention - looking for a \"plushie\" conventiongoer in bright blue fur to match the sample in the costume\\'s mouth. Catherine is perplexed at the sight of the furries in the hotel lobby, while the fascinated Grissom looks at the situation philosophically and psychologically; the two continue this contrast throughout the episode. Grissom decides to attend a lecture.  At the convention, Grissom takes in the lecture, which centers on concepts of the difference between one\\'s form and one\\'s inner spirit or totem, and, during intermission, asks the person next to him if he recognizes Robert, which he doesn\\'t. Catherine has similar bad luck with a man in the lobby clutching a stuffed dog. Finally, both gain leads. After Grissom buys a picture of \"Rocky\" (Robert Pitt) with another furry from a photo vendor, he finds two girls in blue costumes; Willows sees a third blue cat walking down a catwalk during a fashion show. Although this cat - \"Sexy\" - shows some initial playful resistance, hissing at her, all five (the three furries and the two scientists) meet in the lobby.  \"Sexy\" is brought in for questioning, and he reveals his real name to be Bud Simmons. Grissom recognizes the scent of civet oil on Bud\\'s cat suit, and tells him that the costume may have had a part in Robert\\'s death. Simmons admits that he and \"Rocky\" did partake in \"skritching\" - in this context, quasi-sexual caressing - and his costume is taken in for analysis. Robert\\'s semen is found on the costume, as well as ipecac and civet oil.  In interrogation, Bud reluctantly admits that his actions that night led to a \"furpile\" and some \"yiffing\" - in short, an orgy - but denies that he was the one to apply the ipecac and civet oil to his fursuit. Catherine and Grissom make their way to a room at the convention where one such \"furpile\" is still going strong, and enter with a search warrant. Investigation of the fursuits of the participants reveals a wolf costume with ipecac and civet oil on its paws.  The suit\\'s owner, Mr. Lee, is brought in for questioning. Through a number of animal metaphors, Lee explains his actions, first admitting that he indeed applied the mixture to Bud\\'s \"Sexy\" costume. He reveals that \"Rocky\" couldn\\'t get enough of \"Sexy\", and that apparently \"Rocky\" was a very promiscuous individual, as he believes all raccoons (or raccoon characters) to be. In fact, Robert stole \"Linda Lamb\", Lee\\'s girlfriend and the woman who brought him into the furry fandom, from him at the previous year\\'s convention. Mr. Lee then reveals the lamb\\'s real name - the collision victim, Linda Jones. Catherine and Grissom check the trunk of Linda\\'s wrecked car and indeed see the Linda Lamb costume. They form a new conclusion about Robert\\'s death - that Linda, tired of Pitt\\'s philandering with other fursuiters, shot him and left him for dead.  After mulling over the known facts, they determine that Robert was on the side of the road because of a lover\\'s quarrel or \"car fight\" - because of the affair, either Linda kicked him out or he insisted on her letting him out of the car. The fact that Linda\\'s car was heading back toward the hotel suggests to Catherine that she was looking for Robert again to make up. Although the gunshot wound is still unexplained, she finds a valet ticket that might prove valuable.  At the hotel, the valet identifies Linda and Robert, noting that she was angry at Robert and that he was \"hammered.\" Flashbacks reveal the new hypothesis - Robert, still in costume, enters the car, sick from the ipecac. Linda believes he\\'s gone back on alcohol, and the combination of this and his attendance in the furpile makes her extremely angry. Later on, she is mad because Robert is still too delirious or stubborn to remove the mask, and he insists on being let out of the car to vomit. The gunshot still remains unexplained.  Back at the location of Robert\\'s death, Catherine and Grissom find the bullet, which struck from a very steep trajectory. They figure out that Robert was probably on all fours, and when they see a ranger truck driving along a cliff that would be the perfect location for the trajectory of the bullet, they consider the fact that he was not killed as a man but as an animal.  Catherine and Grissom identify the driver of the ranger truck, who, in recounting his night around the time of Linda\\'s vehicle collision, states that he saw a \"coyote\" - Robert - at the side of the road and shot it to protect his own dogs.  The episode ends with Catherine and Grissom incredulous at the full scope of Robert\\'s murder. A final flashback recounts the time after he left the car - doubled over in sickness, Robert is still throwing up when the ranger sees him and fires. Linda turns around to pick him up, and hits him as he crawls across the road. Catherine sums the incident up as a simple \"domestic dispute gone mad,\" while Grissom calls it \"Fur and Loathing in Las Vegas.\"  Victim: Al Sesto (deceased)  On the case: Nick Stokes, Sara Sidle, Sam Vega  At the Big & Best warehouse, a man, Al Sesto, is dead and frozen to the freezer floor. Nick and Sara determine the victim died trying to escape and was hit with a shotgun blast. In the next room, Det. Vega is investigating Petey, the night security guard at Big & Best. Caught in a lie about his whereabouts that night, he confesses to an extended time away from his post. While he was away, Al was murdered and six vending machines were broken into. He states that a man named George came by looking for Al before Petey left, and he ate his dinner when he returned. George\\'s car remains in the parking lot, and Det. Vega investigates.  At the warehouse, Doc Robbins helps remove Al from the freezer floor by pouring boiling water from around the body. Nick looks at the blood spatter at the scene and takes a sample of a frozen blood drop and a shotgun pellet, then finds an unidentified black object and collects it. Sara, meanwhile, dusts for prints.  The black object in the Big & Best freezer is identified as a fragment of a shotgun stock. A gray substance on the fragment is identified as adhesive; the conclusion is that the shotgun owner attempted a very inexpensive repair of the gun\\'s stock. Meanwhile, a man, George Bartell, enters the police department with blood on his hands, reporting a crime. Upon interrogation, he reveals that he sells expired ice cream for cash, and was going to let Al in on the scheme when they found someone smashing the candy machine. The gunman then brought Al and George to the freezer, shot Al, knocked out George and locked him in the trunk of his car. When George came to, he twisted a tire iron loose and opened the trunk to escape. George becomes a suspect, however, when a drop of blood is found on his pants; he is held for further questioning.  Looking over the situation in the warehouse and the single drop of blood on George\\'s pants, Nick and Sara initiate an experiment, showing that although blood spatter at room temperature will stay largely adherent to the surface it hits. However, spatter in a freezer tends to freeze immediately and bounce off as a number of pellets. They surmise, then, that such a pellet hit George\\'s pants and, given the angles, George could not be the shooter. While pondering the identity of the man behind the murder, they get word that George\\'s clothing also had a number of paint chips on it, all dual layered - factory-applied burgundy car paint topped with cheap blue house paint. This, combined with the cheap adhesive found on the gun fragment, lower Nick and Sara\\'s opinion of the killer.  The adhesive on the gunstock fragment is identified as granite surface adhesive. As there are few granite specialists in the area, this narrows the search for the gunman down considerably. A man named Virgil is brought in for questioning after being found in connection with both the car and the granite company. Despite the evidence, Virgil denies knowing Al Sesto, remains quiet and demands a lawyer.  George and Virgil see each other in the halls of the police department. Virgil, forgetting himself (and proving himself as dimwitted as the CSIs believed) explicitly admits to the murder by saying he \"should have shot [George] in that freezer.\" George realizes his absentmindedness when he remembers everything he\\'d innocently told Virgil, including the vending machines and Petey\\'s lax attendance on duty.

      "s04e22 ['Synopsis The CSIs investigate when two young gamblers are found dead shortly after scamming several of Sam #Braun \\'s casinos . #Grissom is forced to take #Catherine off the case because #Catherine father is a suspect in their murder .   Plot Victims : Teddy #Keller ( deceased ) , Davis #Mullins ( deceased )   On the case : Entire team   In a dark room , a young man is questioned under a spotlight by two unseen people . One of the unseen people asks the young man if he knows what happened to people like him back in the day . The young man is sweating bullets while this interrogation is going on . He insists that he it \\'s illegal to hold him in the room ; the interrogator replies that there is no law in the room . The young man is later found dead in a neon graveyard with two shots to the back of the head . #Catherine , #Grissom and #Brass are on the scene ; #Grissom notices that the victim is wearing a wig and a fat suit . #Brass finds the victim \\'s ID ; the victim \\'s name is Ernie #Menlo . Robbery is ruled out for the time being since there is a still a Rolex on the victim \\'s wrist .   Later on , #Catherine gets off of the phone with #Brass and relays the information to #Grissom that there is no Ernie #Menlo in the system and that the ID is fake . #Grissom bags the wig as evidence and notes that there is gun shot residue in the wound tract ; the shots are close range , but non - contact . #Catherine is unable to find any shell casings and wonders if this was a professional hit and that the hitman picked up the casings . David #Phillips looks over the body and notes that there are major fractures and lacerations on both of the victim \\'s hands . Lividity suggests that this was not a body dump . #Grissom bags some of the nearby gravel and glass as evidence . There are tire tracks in the dirt indicating that a vehicle made a three - point turn ; #Catherine photographs the tracks and whips out a tape measure to measure the wheelbase . Meanwhile , #Grissom finds a receipt in the victim \\'s pocket ; the victim had won $ 436,278 at the Rampart Casino the previous morning . #Grissom shows the receipt to #Catherine and notes that robbery may be a motive after all . When #Catherine offers to go to the Rampart to speak to Sam #Braun , #Grissom tells #Catherine that , since Sam is #Catherine father , #Catherine is off the case due to conflict of interest . #Catherine begrudgingly hands #Grissom #Catherine equipment and walks away .   In the morgue , #Catherine and #Warrick process the body ; #Catherine removes something from the victim \\'s forehead and bags it as evidence , while #Warrick works on the victim \\'s lacerated hand . David starts bagging the clothes as evidence , as well . #Catherine removes the victim \\'s Rolex and finds that it is authentic and that , since the logo sticker is n\\'t worn down , the watch could be new . #Warrick figures that the victim won the jackpot and celebrated by buying #Warrick some expensive stuff . #Warrick then finds that the victim is wearing air conditioned socks and that one of them has three holes in it .   #Grissom and #Brass head to the Rampart . While #Grissom looks up at the \" eye in the sky , \" #Brass tells #Warrick that #Warrick talked to the pit boss that signed the victim \\'s W-2 and that the pit boss remembers the big winner . Soon thereafter , Sam #Braun appears and tells #Grissom and #Brass that the victim was cheating . #Grissom asks ~Sam if #Grissom took the victim to the \" box \" ; ~Sam replies that it \\'s now called \" The Holding Room . \" ~Sam brings #Grissom to the room , which looks like the room the victim was sitting in at the beginning of the episode . #Grissom notes that the room smells like the cleaning staff just left . ~Sam admits to #Grissom that the victim was brought to the room at 2:00 AM where ~they talked for an hour ; the victim was then released . ~Sam tells #Grissom that the security camera in the room recorded everything , and #Grissom replies that ~they \\'ll look at the tapes later . #Grissom searches the room for evidence of blood , but does n\\'t find any . While #Grissom is doing this , ~Sam tells #Grissom that the victim was cheating at roulette and that #Grissom questioned the victim as to how #Grissom was doing it . ~Sam then antagonizes #Grissom by asking ~Sam what bothers ~Sam more - the fact that they could n\\'t pin a murder on ~Sam or the fact that #Catherine cashed the check #Grissom gave #Catherine .   Back in the morgue , Doc #Robbins tells #Warrick that bruises on the victim \\'s heel correspond to the holes in his sock . The victim has a fat lip , which Doc #Robbins believes occurred an hour or two before death . Two bullets are removed from the victim \\'s brain ; #Warrick says that they look like .22 caliber bullets , which Doc #Robbins notes is a hitman \\'s bullet of choice . The doc also says that the bruises and fractures to the hands also occurred before death . #Warrick guesses that object used to fracture the hands was a ball peen hammer due to the fact that it used to be used back in the day to discourage cheaters .   #Warrick goes over the victim \\'s clothing and looks over one of the shoes . On the underside of the shoe , #Warrick finds shards of colored glass embedded in the treads . #Warrick removes the slip from the shoe and finds an elaborate series of buttons and switches tied to a battery . #Warrick finds #Grissom and tells #Warrick that , as far as #Warrick can tell , the device is a wireless receiver that picks up a signal and solenoids drive the points up against the victim \\'s foot , revealing what to bet on . #Grissom notes that if there is a receiver , there is a transmitter . #Sara interrupts ~them and tells ~them the victim \\'s real name is Teddy #Keller ; his name and home address had been recorded when he bought the Rolex .   #Warrick and #Brass visit ~Teddy \\'s apartment complex ; the manager , Joseph #Greene , tells them that ~Davis has a roommate named Davis #Mullins . They enter the apartment , which #Warrick notes is freezing . There is a regulation roulette wheel on a table and various charts and graphs indicating that the roommates had a cheating system in place . #Brass searches the apartment and finds ~Davis lying dead in the bedroom . ~Davis has also received two gunshots to the back of the head . #Warrick notices a blood smear on the body , as well as a white mark on the shoulder . Meanwhile , #Brass finds wigs and cosmetics in the closet and a box full of wireless receivers nearby , one of which has a print on the clear plastic covering . Outside of the apartment , #Grissom finds shards of colored glass at the bottom of a stairwell .   #Catherine is on a date with Chris #Bezich when ~Sam walks up on them . #Catherine tells ~Sam that #Catherine can get fired just for having this conversation , but ~Sam tells #Catherine that it \\'s a small town and ~Sam \\'s always running into someone ~Sam knows . ~Sam tells #Catherine that some people think ~Sam \\'s a murderer , but #Catherine angrily replies that some people know ~Sam \\'s a murderer . ~Sam puts a hand on #Catherine shoulder and tells #Catherine that ~Sam did n\\'t kill those kids , implying that ~Sam knows that there \\'s more than one . ~Sam eventually gets into ~Sam limousine ; #Catherine notices that ~it makes a three - point turn before ~it departs .   David #Hodges tells #Grissom that the glass found in the apartment complex stairwell is consistent with the glass found at the first crime scene . Meanwhile , in the locker room , #Nick tells #Sara that #Nick \\'s been recommended by #Grissom for the key CSI position ; however , the position was cut , as the department only had money for that or a bio robot . #Sara processes this information as #Nick tells #Sara it was just an honor to be nominated . Elsewhere , #Grissom and #Warrick look over all of the roulette evidence gathered from the apartment . #Warrick tells #Warrick that #Warrick was reading up on a group of people that used physics to gain an advantage on the roulette wheel . #Warrick guesses that one of the guys did the calibration and noted the position of the ball and that the computer could play out the spin in milliseconds , predicting the result . The transmitter would then send the code to the receiver allowing the other person to place their bet . #Warrick says that this system gave ~Davis and ~Teddy a 44 % advantage over the house . #Nick walks in and says that they got a hit off of the print recovered from the transmitter in the shoe ; the print belongs Seth #Landers , an electrical engineering grad student at WLVU . ~Seth has a record , having gotten arrested a few years back for making fake IDs .   #Nick and #Brass go to the WLVU campus looking for ~Seth , but find ~Seth doom room empty . As they are walking away , they spot a student unlocking ~Seth bike . #Brass calls out ~Seth \\'s name , and ~Seth takes off running . When ~Seth is caught , ~Seth yells out that ~Seth does n\\'t want to be killed and that ~Seth \\'ll do whatever Sam #Braun wants . ~Seth is brought to the station for interrogation . There , ~Seth tells #Warrick and #Brass that the scheme was ~Davis and ~Teddy \\'s idea and that ~Seth did n\\'t even get a cut of the winnings , ~Seth just wanted to build the device to see if the plan could work . The plan was to win $ 20,000-$30,000 per night , but ~Davis and ~Teddy got greedy . They hit three different ~Sam #Braun - owned casinos since they \\'re low - tech and were less likely to cause interference with the transmitters . ~Seth admits that ~Seth saw ~Teddy get taken to the \" box , \" but ~Seth thought they were in the clear when ~Teddy emerged with the money still in ~Teddy possession . However , ~Teddy says that shortly after that , ~Teddy was apprehended again , and that \\'s the last time ~Seth saw either ~Davis or Teddy .   #Catherine stops by #Grissom \\'s office and tells ~Teddy of #Catherine run - in with ~Sam . #Catherine lets ~Teddy know that ~Sam got into a limousine with a wide turning radius and convinces #Grissom that #Grissom should use #Grissom good character to get a warrant for the vehicle . #Grissom and #Sara process the limousine ; they find that the distance from front tire to rear tire is 20 feet . #Sara finds shards of colored glass in the rear tire treads , indicating that it was at the neon graveyard . They spray the back of the limousine with luminol and #Grissom finds traces of blood . While this is going on , #Sara questions #Grissom as to why #Nick received the now - cut promotion and #Sara did n\\'t ; #Grissom replies that it \\'s because #Nick did n\\'t care whether #Grissom got the promotion or not . This answer is not good enough for #Sara .   #Warrick and #Brass go to the Rampart . They find ~Sam , and #Brass places ~Sam under arrested for the murder of Teddy #Keller . In the interrogation room , #Grissom tells ~Sam and ~Sam lawyer that the tire patterns found at the scene of ~Teddy \\'s murder are consistent with the wheel base and turning radius of ~Sam \\'s limousine . #Grissom also mentions that the shards of colored glass were found in the treads of all four tires . Additionally , the blood found in the backseat was a match to ~Teddy . #Brass guesses that ~Sam waited until ~Teddy cleared the security cameras and had ~Teddy staff escort ~Teddy to the limousine . There , ~Sam hit ~Teddy with the back of ~Sam hand , drawing blood . ~They then took ~Teddy to the neon graveyard to show what happens to cheaters - ~They leaned ~Teddy up against one of the signs and beat ~Teddy with a hammer . ~Sam whispers something to ~Sam lawyer . The lawyer then tells #Grissom and #Brass that ~Sam simply offered ~Teddy a ride home ; they took a detour to the neon graveyard to have a chat about the ethics of cheating and defrauding a casino . #Brass notes that ~Teddy left the casino with the money , but the lawyer says ~Teddy returned the money as a sign of respect .   At the Rampart , #Warrick walks around with a miniature frequency counter to take some electronic noise measurements . Back in the lab , #Hodges tells #Warrick that the white paint found on ~Davis \\'s body was an interior paint with the color Navajo White . #Warrick meets up with #Grissom and tells #Warrick that the casino floor was a mess of interference and that electronics in old casinos are n\\'t shielded . #Warrick believes that ~Seth would have known better than to use the old casinos for the scam and that maybe #Warrick was setting up #Warrick friends . #Warrick then searches for ~Seth in the computer and brings up #Warrick driver \\'s license . #Warrick recognizes a past address ; it \\'s the apartment complex where ~Davis and ~Teddy lived . Ironically , apartment manager Joseph #Greene has the same address .   #Warrick and #Brass find Joseph in a convenience store playing a slot machine . He reveals that ~Seth is his son and wants to know if he \\'s okay . As Joseph goes to pull the slot machine lever again , #Brass notices an injury to his hand . Joseph says it \\'s an old injury ; when #Warrick asks #Warrick if Sam #Braun did that to #Warrick , he replies that he does n\\'t know who that is . Nevertheless , Joseph is brought to the police station for questioning .   At the station , Sam #Braun is escorted to the waiting room and given a seat next to Joseph . Joseph stares long and hard at ~Sam while #Grissom and #Brass watch the interaction from a distance . #Brass tells #Grissom that Joseph ( aka Joseph #Landers ) and ~Sam are old friends . An officer comes in to escort Joseph to interrogation ; ~Sam notices the bruises on Joseph \\'s hand and gleefully asks him if it hurts when it rains . Once again , Joseph feigns ignorance and pretends to not know who ~Sam is .   In interrogation , #Brass brings up the fact that Joseph was banned from all casinos for cheating in the past . In fact , he had been caught cheating in one of Sam #Braun \\'s casinos . Joseph claims that he did n\\'t cheat and that he simply beat the casinos . #Brass guesses that the plan the boys hatched was Joseph \\'s plan and that he put his son , Seth , in the middle of it . He even wonders if ~Seth killed his two partners . Joseph categorically denies this and says that they should be looking at ~Sam for the murders .   At the WLVU campus , ~garbage is found in ~Seth \\'s dumpster . Amongst ~garbage garbage is a .22 caliber revolver with four expended rounds wrapped in a bloody green t - shirt . In the lab , test shots are fired from the gun ; #Warrick finds that the test bullet matches the bullet found in ~Teddy \\'s body . However , #Warrick is still unsettled about the case - why would ~Seth come up with a plan to scam the casinos and kill ~Seth partners , but leave the gun in ~Seth dorm ? Furthermore , the .22 caliber revolver is a small weapon for an up - close - and - personal hit . There were two different types of ammo in the gun ; #Nick and #Warrick are able to do some backtracking and they find that ~Davis was actually killed before ~Teddy was . Their timeline is off .   #Greg finds #Grissom and tells #Greg that the blood recovered from the t - shirt in the dumpster belongs to Davis #Mullins ; however , epithelials on the inside of the shirt belong to ~Seth . #Grissom is seemingly disappointed with the results , as this means that ~Sam is innocent of the murders . #Warrick visits ~Seth in #Warrick cell and asks #Warrick what #Warrick did after ~Teddy was hauled away . ~Seth reveals that ~Seth waited outside of the casino for an hour ; when ~Teddy did n\\'t show up , ~Seth went to ~Teddy \\'s apartment to look for ~Teddy . There , ~Seth found ~Davis dead in the bedroom . ~Seth touched ~Davis \\'s body and got blood on ~Seth hands , which ~Seth absent mindedly wiped on ~Seth shirt . When confronted with the fact that the gun was found wrapped in ~Seth bloody t - shirt , ~Seth insists that ~Seth \\'s never fired a gun in ~Seth life . ~Seth is also surprised that the shirt was found outside of ~Seth dorm room . #Warrick has ~Seth retrace #Warrick steps , and ~Seth remembers that #Warrick came to #Warrick father in a panic and handed #Warrick the bloody shirt . ~Seth comes to the realization that ~Seth was set up by this father . ~Seth admits that ~Seth just wanted ~Seth father to like ~Seth and ~Seth went to scam Sam #Braun as a way of proving ~Seth to ~Seth .   #Grissom and #Warrick head to the apartment complex to look for evidence that incriminates Joseph . They find nothing in Joseph \\'s apartment ; however , #Grissom finds traces of white paint on a key ring handle , as well as one of the keys . The key opens the door to an apartment that is in the process of being painted . #Warrick finds a paint can in the middle of the floor and notes that the color is Navajo White , the same paint that was on ~Davis \\'s shirt . In the closet , #Grissom finds a backpack full of money from both Pike \\'s Casino and the Tangiers ; additionally , there are paint and blood smears on the backpack . #Warrick wonders why Joseph would kill the kids when they were making him money and helping him get revenge on ~Sam . #Grissom guesses that when Joseph saw the opportunity to frame ~Sam for murder , it stopped being about the money . A flashback shows Joseph getting a call from ~Teddy telling him that ~Sam was on to the scam . Joseph went to their apartment and shot ~Davis , then went to the neon graveyard where ~Teddy was waiting for ~Teddy and shot ~Teddy , as well . He then beat ~Teddy \\'s hands with a hammer and propped ~Teddy up against a sign .   #Catherine meets up with ~Sam and offers to buy ~Teddy dinner as an apology . #Catherine learns that ~Sam has hired ~Seth as an opportunity to work off ~Seth debt . \" You want to catch a cheater - you hire one , \" ~Teddy tells #Catherine . Before ~Teddy leaves , ~Teddy adds that one way or another , ~Teddy always gets ~Teddy money \\'s worth .']\n",
      "s04e21 ['Synopsis #Grissom , #Nick and #Sara investigate when a roller coaster derails at an amusement park , leaving six people dead . When it turns out there were only five people on the roller coaster , they suspect foul play . #Catherine and #Warrick investigate the murder of a 13-year old girl .   Plot Victim : Multiple victims ( deceased )   On the case : Gil #Grissom , #Nick Stokes , #Sara #Sidle , Jim #Brass   At Sphinx Amusement Park , a family of four rides the roller coaster called \" Pharaoh \\'s Fever . \" They disembark and walk to a nearby stand to order something to eat . Suddenly , screams are heard and the cars are shown flying off of the track and into the parking lot , crushing a car . Later , #Grissom arrives on the scene , where #Brass tells him that six people are dead .   #Nick and #Sara soon arrive on the scene with #Greg in tow . #Grissom tells them that due to the criminal and civil liabilities issues , they have to keep it quiet and not talk to the press . After #Grissom gives them orders and asks if there any questions , #Greg asks him why one victim is so far away from the others . #Grissom notes that this is curious , but simply walks away . #Sara tells #Greg that #Sara guess is that the victim did n\\'t have his seat belt buckled , so he flew further than the other victims on the ride .   #Sara photographs the evidence in the parking lot , while #Nick bags ~it and #Greg documents ~it . Meanwhile , #Brass talks to ride operator Zack #Lawrence , who tells ~him that the training ~him received to operate the ride was to release the hand brake and hit the \" Go \" button when the light was green . #Brass asks ~Zack to remember who was on the ride , and ~Zack only remembers five people . There is a vendor booth nearby with a sign that reads \" See Yourself Scream \" ; ~Zack tells #Brass that an on - ride digital camera takes photos of the passengers and stores them in the computer \\'s hard drive . Despite the train being airborne and not reaching the part of the ride where the camera is , #Brass says that #Brass \\'re going to need the computer .   Elsewhere , #Grissom questions #Woody , the park \\'s chief engineer . #Woody insists that all of the rides are up to code and did n\\'t think an accident like this was possible . During the conversation , #Grissom spots a piece of metal on the ground and picks it up with #Grissom pen . #Woody says that it \\'s a nut that secures the wheel to the screw ; however , #Grissom claims that one loose wheel could n\\'t cause a whole train to derail . For that to happen , all eight wheels would have to be loose . #Grissom then visits #Nick , #Sara and #Greg in the large tent they set up in the parking lot where the evidence is being held . #Grissom tells them #Grissom \\'s looking for a screw , and #Nick hands #Grissom a container full of them . #Grissom observes that the end threads on the screws were stripped , which means the nuts were loose . #Grissom also finds tool marks that left vertical striations and #Nick guesses that a pipe wrench could have been used .   Doc #Robbins has the bodies lined up in the morgue and gives #Grissom and rundown of their names and causes of death . One of the victims is Jim Nevins , a 20-year old park employee who died from an impact to the head . #Grissom notes that ~Zack told ~Zack that only five people were on the coaster and that none of them were employees of the park . #Grissom wonders if ~Jim was in the wrong place at the wrong time and got hit by a falling roller coaster , but Doc #Robbins informs #Grissom that ~Jim \\'s rigor mortis and body temperature put #Grissom time of death sixteen hours before the other victims around 1:00 AM .   #Grissom and #Sara head back to the park and examine the underside of the coaster \\'s loading platform . They see that the wheels would have been in reach and that anyone could have had access to tamper with them . #Sara finds what looks like lubricant on the track and swabs it for evidence . The sound of metal on metal draws #Grissom \\'s attention ; #Woody tells #Woody that ~it \\'s a detached support beam , but ~it \\'s just a cosmetic problem . #Woody had fixed the beam several times during the year and recorded it in #Woody maintenance log . As #Woody talks to #Grissom and #Sara , they notice a pipe wrench in #Woody \\'s tool bag and bag it as evidence . Meanwhile , #Nick gives #Grissom a call and tells him that ~Jim \\'s body was covered in trilobal red fibers ; #Grissom guesses that the fibers are from a car \\'s interior .   In the parking lot tent , #Greg tells #Grissom and #Sara that the roller coaster broke into 106 different parts ; however , he found one that thing that is n\\'t supposed to belong - semen . #Grissom informs them that the release of epinephrine and adrenaline while riding a coaster could produce a stimulatory effect . #Grissom then notices a red T - Bird , which #Greg tells #Grissom belongs to Jim Nevins , the dead park employee . #Sara finds a pipe wrench in the back seat of the car that has blood on it , while #Grissom discovers that there is a blood pool in the trunk . #Grissom wonders if ~Jim was hit over the head with a pipe wrench and stuffed in the trunk of #Grissom own car , lying in a pool of blood . The roller coaster hitting the car would have ejected ~Jim from the trunk , which would be more in line with their findings so far . #Sara finds this far - fetched , but #Grissom says that #Grissom \\'s just following the evidence .   #Brass has Zack #Lawrence called into the station for questioning . Zack tells him that he remembers ~Jim \\'s T - Bird being in the parking lot when he closed up the amusement park at 10:00 PM the night before the accident . He says that ~Jim would sometimes stay in the park after closing and take his dates on the coaster , which was no big deal to his fellow employees . However , Zack does n\\'t know the name of ~Jim \\'s date from the night before the accident . #Brass wonders how ~Jim got access to the park at night if all of the power was shut down ; Zack tells him that the same key that opens the men \\'s room door also opens up all of the power boxes in the park . There is also no security , as the last security guard got laid off during a round of budget cuts .   #Nick takes mold samples of the two pipe wrenches and finds that the tool marks from the sabotaged nut are a match to the wrench found in the T - Bird . #Nick tells #Grissom that #Nick theory is that ~Jim loosed the screws on the coaster , then was attacked when #Nick left the park and killed with #Nick own wrench . #Nick also says that #Nick got a partial print off of the wrench and that it matched one of the two sets of prints found on the T - Bird \\'s trunk ; the other print is unknown . #Greg enters and tells #Grissom and #Nick that the semen found in the coaster belonged to ~Jim and #Greg relays the information that ~Jim used to take dates on coaster rides . #Nick believes #Nick theory is no good , as nobody would sabotage their own \" sex machine . \"   #Sara goes through the on - ride photos from the computer the park sent over . She is looking at the day of the accident , but #Nick has her go back in time , as #Nick is aware of ~Jim \\'s escapades . Sure enough , ~they find ~Jim riding the coaster with a girl ; the timestamp is 12:45 AM , fifteen minutes before ~Jim death . ~they know ~they need to find the girl in the photo . #Grissom and #Sara visit the amusement park again to look for the girl . They run into #Woody , who identifies the girl as \" Cleopartra \" and #Grissom tells them she works in food services . They find \" Cleopatra \" on break ; she tells them that her real name is Lisa #Hunt . ~Lisa tells #Grissom and #Sara that ~Lisa had no idea the on - ride camera worked at night . ~Lisa admits that ~Lisa had always had a crush on ~Jim , and that ~Lisa agreed to go out with ~Jim when ~Jim asked ~Lisa . #Grissom asks ~Lisa what ~they did after the coaster ride ; ~Lisa says that ~they talked and kissed . ~Jim offered to drive ~Lisa home , but ~Lisa decided to walk since ~Lisa does n\\'t live far away . #Sara asks ~Lisa if #Sara noticed anyone else around ; ~Lisa says no , but admits that ~Lisa was n\\'t really looking .   David #Hodges pulls #Sara into his lab and informs #Sara that the substance #Sara collected from the track is doxepin ointment , which is prescribed to treat dermatological inflammations caused by coming into contact with certain types of plants . #Sara guesses that whoever messed with the coaster rubbed up against the track , transferring the ointment ; #Hodges tells #Sara that their killer has a rash . With this knowledge , #Sara checks the pharmaceutical database and finds that doxepin has only been prescribed to twelve people in Clark County ; Lisa #Hunt is one of those names .   In interrogation , ~Lisa admits to #Grissom and #Sara that ~Lisa had a rash on ~Lisa leg and used ~doxepin to get rid of ~doxepin . When asked how ~Lisa got the rash , ~Lisa says ~Lisa was studying with someone in the grass and rubbed on something when they went for a walk . It turns out that the person ~Lisa was with was ~Lisa math tutor , Zack #Lawrence . ~Lisa confirms that Zack also had the rash , as ~Lisa gave him some of ~Lisa ointment .   #Sara and #Brass visit Zack at the amusement park , where he is sweeping the merry - go - round . Zack confirms that he used some of ~Lisa \\'s ointment ; #Sara says that it \\'s actually illegal to use someone else \\'s prescription . Zack lays his broom aside as #Brass takes him away for more questioning and #Sara dusts the broom for prints . In interrogation , Zack shows #Grissom and #Sara #Grissom rash . #Sara tells #Grissom that the prints lifted from #Grissom broom match the prints on ~Jim \\'s T - Bird and the prints on the pipe wrench .   #Sara points out that Zack is a straight \" A \" student with a scholarship to Stanford University . When pressed , Zack admits that he had feelings for Lisa , which is why he took a $ 12/hour job at the amusement park when he \\'s already making $ 20/hour tutoring . He got jealous when he found out ~Jim was taking ~Lisa on one of his \" coaster dates \" and loosened the screws on the coaster . The problem is , he did n\\'t loosen them enough . Zack went to Plan B and attacked ~Jim in the parking lot with a pipe wrench , then stuffed the body in trunk of the T - Bird . #Sara asks Zack why he did n\\'t tighten the screws after his plan failed , and Zack replies that he just did n\\'t think about it . That cost five other people their lives .   Victim : #Tessa #Press ( deceased )   On the case : #Catherine Willows , #Warrick #Brown   #Catherine and #Warrick are called to the scene where the body of 13-year old #Tessa #Press has been found . They meet David #Phillips at the scene ; #Catherine immediately notices that the body position is inconsistent with the lividity . Lividity shows that #Tessa died face - down , but someone had dumped her face - up . ~David rolls the body to show #Catherine the instar maggots that are crawling over #Tessa \\'s back . Based on the temperature and the previous night \\'s rainfall , ~David estimates that #Tessa has been in her current location for 24 hours . The rain may have washed away most of the evidence , so #Catherine and #Warrick hope that there is enough evidence still on the body . ~David wonders why someone would take the time to drive out and dump the body , but not take extra time to bury it so nobody would find it .   In the police station , ~Raina \\'s mother Raina positively identifies ~Raina daughter \\'s body from the autopsy photo . #Warrick tells her that #Tessa died over 24 hours ago ; ~Raina replies that she did n\\'t report her daughter missing because she would sleep over at a friend \\'s house a few nights per week . Since she works nights , but that she is home when #Tessa would get home from school . When #Tessa did n\\'t come home that day , ~Raina assumed that she was at the friend \\'s house .   In autopsy , ~David tells #Warrick that #Tessa \\'s had a lacerated spinal cord and that her cause of death was asphyxia due to diaphragmatic paralysis . #Warrick notices that there is soil inside of the neck wound ; #Warrick finds this odd , noting that soil should be around the wound and on it , but not inside of it . #Catherine and #Warrick visit a mini mart not far from where #Tessa would get off the school bus . The manager has told #Warrick that #Catherine recognized #Tessa and remembered seeing #Catherine the day #Catherine was killed . They also confirmed that #Tessa would spend at least two nights per week at her friend \\'s house ; however , there was no set schedule and the friend \\'s parents figured #Tessa was at home hen she did n\\'t show up . #Catherine spots a security camera in the mini mart \\'s parking lot ; #Warrick tells #Catherine that #Warrick has already secured the footage .   #Warrick is able to find #Tessa in the security camera footage ; there , #Warrick sees a boy grabbing her arm and trying to take her away . They are able to identify the boy as 15-year old #Henry Capana , who tells #Catherine and #Warrick that #Warrick would sit next to #Tessa on the school bus . #Warrick says that #Warrick felt sorry for #Tessa , as other kids would make fun of her hair and clothing . #Henry explains that #Henry had just gotten #Henry learner \\'s permit and that #Henry was simply offering a ride to #Tessa . #Tessa declined , telling #Henry that someone was coming to pick her up . #Henry says that #Henry saw #Tessa get into a truck , but #Henry did n\\'t see who was driving it .   #Warrick meets up with #Catherine and tells #Catherine that the trace inside #Tessa \\'s wound is zoodoo , a compost made up of the feces of different animals that keeps deer away . ~Zoodoo is imported from Auckland , New Zealand , and is used by one company in Clark County called ADL Landscaping . #Warrick finds out that #Tessa \\'s mother , Raina , hired ~ADL a few months back for a job . They head to ~Raina \\'s house and see an ~ADL truck in the driveway with tools in the truck bed ; #Catherine finds this odd , as ~Zoodoo company was hired months ago . When they knock on the door , ~Raina answers with ~Raina boyfriend , Justin #Mack ; ~Justin is wearing an ~ADL shirt .   While #Catherine talks to ~Raina inside the house , #Warrick questions ~Justin outside in the driveway . ~Justin says that #Tessa would take the bus home from school , but that he would sometimes pick her up from school , buy her an ice cream cone , and drop her off at her house . With ~Justin \\'s permission , #Warrick tests the tools in the truck for blood and finds evidence of blood on a shovel . Meanwhile , ~Raina tells #Catherine that ~Justin is a good man and that he would never hurt anyone , especially #Tessa .   The evidence is processed - the blood on the shovel is #Tessa \\'s , while the fingerprints lifted from the handle of the shovel belong to ~Raina . A flashback shows #Warrick spraying luminol in the backseat of ~Raina \\'s car and finding evidence of blood . In interrogation , #Warrick tells ~Raina that the weapon used and the method of body disposal do not suggest premediated murder . As ~Raina gets angrier during the interrogation , #Catherine asks what set #Catherine off . ~Raina complains to #Catherine that #Catherine bought #Tessa a bus pass , but #Catherine would still get a ride home from school with ~Justin . A clearly unhinged ~Raina accused #Tessa of trying to steal ~Justin away from her . As #Tessa denied this and walked away from their argument , ~Raina grabbed a shovel and hit #Tessa in the back of the head . #Catherine incensed #Catherine berates ~Raina for killing #Catherine 13-year old child and leaves the interrogation room .']\n"
